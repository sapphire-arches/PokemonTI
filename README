OVERVIEW: 

	The goal of this project is to create a playable Pokemon-like game on the
TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-84, TI-84+, and the TI-84+ Silver
Edition. We are using z88dk (www.z88dk.org) compile. The game is written in C
using z88dk's sprite library for graphics. The default target is MirageOS. By
editing the makefile, it is probably possible to change this target with few
problems.

BUILDING:

	1. Make sure that you have GNU MAKE, and z88dk in your PATH.
	2. Type make.
	3. Use TI-Connect, TI-Graphlink, or TILP to upload the resulting
		POKE.8xp file to your calculator.

RUNNING:
	1. Make sure you have MirageOS on your calcuator. You can get it from
		the detached solutions website 
			(http://www.detachedsolutions.com/mirageos/)
		or TICalc.org
			(http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/139/13949.html)
	2. Open MirageOS (Press APPS, then ON)
	3. If this is the first time you have opened MirageOS, you will be greeted
		with a splash screen. Press 2ND or ENTER to continue.
